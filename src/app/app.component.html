        <p>Poured into a goblet, the beer offers some amazing head retention and rings of white lace sticking to the glass after each sip. Good clarity, with a dull golden color. The nose contains apricots and pear, faint ground white pepper, chalky yeast and an aroma of shortbread biscuits. It's very crisp and lively with a smooth back and moderate body. Spicy phenols wrap around its dry maltiness, which is similar to crusty bread, highlighted by some pithy notes of green banana. Spicy hops, with a flare from the alcohol, provide a nice bite along with a moderate grassy bitterness. Earthy on the palate with a flash of honey-like sweetness. Yeasty and fruity undertones layer middle to end. Finishes dry.</p>

        <p>The Wanderer is a special blend of oak aged ales that we made with Craig and Beth from San Francisco's City Beer Store. Blending a mix of sour ales and our anniversary ale the base of this beer has a delightfully sour tinge on top of a hearty malt backbone. To add to the flavor, Craig and Beth selected blackberries and bing cherries to be added to the ale adding to it's already fruity complexity. This ale went on to win the silver medal for wood &amp; barrel aged sour fruited ales at the 2011 Great American Beer Festival.</p>

        <p>The 11.2-ounce stubby bottle pours a muddy copper with a creamy and frothy beige head and sticky retention. Decanted carefully to keep the dregs (which are plentiful) from pouring out of the bottle. Yeasty, lightly vegetal, metallic, with a subtle spiciness and sweet alcohol in the nose. Light on the palate, with a prickly carbonation and creaminess in its wake. Delicious dark fruitiness of cherries, raisins and ripe plums. Very malty, with undertones of sweet chocolate, mild coffee and caramelized sugars. Crisp, dry edge. Spicy alcohol, a splash of coriander, and a slight tartness that helps tease and tame the sweetness. Soft, drying, powdery feel in the finish. Incredibly moore-ish as in, why, yes we'd love to have another. And with a very deceptive 11 percent alcohol by volume, we will.</p>

Yeasty and fruity undertones layer middle to end. Finishes dry.</p>

        <p>Rich, golden color with dark amber and orange hues and a touch of chill haze that clears as the beer warms. Carbonation is quite active, with abnormally large bubbles frothing into a thick white foam head that piles high, sticks and leaves a healthy lacing. Steely and mineral in the nose, soft and powdery, with a dusting of herbal and malty-sweet suggestions. Very smooth on the palate; even and medium-bodied. Malty with bready and biscuity notes running through a light and toasty sweetness. An aggressive alcohol cuts through with spice and a burn, prickling the palate. Distinct herbal hops characters meet the alcohol spice and meld well. Faint taste of ripe stone fruit beneath. Toasty finish, slightly drying, powdery dash of spices.</p>

        <p>Pours fizzy, creating a beige/eggshell-colored foamy head that's dense image and wonderfully laced, sticking to the glass and also retaining magnificently. In fact, the lacing stays until the end. Beneath, a deep brown brew with rich tawny hues. This beer has some serious legs. Complex aromas: soft and powdery on the nose, with aromas of malt, chocolate chip cookie dough and a deep-rooted fruitiness, notes of plum skins, spicy phenols and a soft bready yeast character.</p>
